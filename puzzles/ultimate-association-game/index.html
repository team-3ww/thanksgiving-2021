                <li>A player who is the title character of a film trilogy, where the second word in the middle entry's
                    title is a two-digit number representing the number of people that the player immediately
                    before this player superstitiously refuses to "dine" with</li>
                <li>A player from Clare's favorite 2010 film (directed by someone with an earlier film entry that exactly
                    describes this player's condition)</li>
                <li>A player who is the protagonist of a film that has the plural noun of Becky's favorite animal in its
                    title, portrayed by the actress who co-starred in a Wall Street film containing a word in its title
                    that would describe two other players</li>
                <li>A player who insists that his name be prefaced with a naval title when addressed. His first name is
                    the same as that of an iconic lover portrayed by the same actor who portrayed the player immediately
                    after this player</li>

                    role</li>
                <li>A player who is the close friend of (but later becomes antagonist to) a symbol expert. This
                    symbology expert is an Ivy League professor with the same initials as a player two positions before
                    this player, and who's portrayed by the same actor who portrayed a character whose last name is in
                    Tommy's Wi-Fi password</li>
                <li>A player with the same initials as yours truly</li>
                <li>A one-eyed, yellow-colored player who plays the same instrument as Ben</li>
                <li>A player who taught at the same school as one of the nefarious players</li>
                <li>A player who dies at the end of a classic tale that takes place in two locations which will host the
                    Olympic Games twelve years apart, one of which is the capital city of the country where a player
                    immediately after him resides</li>
